        <h2>Who are Indian Football fans?</h2>

        <p>To describe or define Indian Football fans is quite difficult; they support their respective European clubs, countries qualified for football clubs and finally Indian football clubs. These fans support European clubs like Manchester United, Liverpool, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich etc. through the season. They even stay late night awake to watch the UEFA champions League matches which results in missing school/office train/bus. Also napping whenever or wherever one gets time and space. There are also official support fan groups in every major cities in India where fans come to watch the game together and celebrate wins or loses. To give you examples there are <a href="https://manutdmumbai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manchester United Mumbai</a>, <a href="https://www.realmadridpune.com/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madrid Pune</a>, <a href="https://www.lfcmumbai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liverpool Mumbai</a> and many more.</p>
        
        <p>Indian Football fans also support a country in FIFA World Cup you heard it right they support a country that have qualified for world cup. They support the likes of Argentina, Brazil, Spain, France, Germany not England for obvious reasons. In the period of World Cup they paint the murals of their favourite players, make big cut outs of players and place them in squares, and on some occasions, they have small brawls.</p>

        <p>However, and this is a big but they all do not support or watch Indian football clubs matches. Reasons are many some not in the control of the fans and the administrative issues. To start with, the access to stadiums is not great, some are located outskirts of the city area and the ground are not in total control of the clubs. Recently FIFA had banned AIFF for reasons, which are well documented, and recently the ban has been lifted. The climatic conditions of India also play a part as India is hot the players get affected by this. The result of this is quality, pace of the game goes down which makes difficult for European football fans to watch Indian league matches.</p>

        <p>Although the most important thing is when Indian Football team matches are streamed the most of the Indian football fans watch these matches. It is a cliché but “Divided by clubs United by Country”.</p>

        <p>To define Indian Football Fan in a word is <strong><i>PASSION</i></strong>.</p>
