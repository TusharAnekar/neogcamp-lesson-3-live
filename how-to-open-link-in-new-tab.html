        <h2>How to open a link in new tab using HTML.</h2>
        <p>Before you get into reading the technical content of this blog, one must ask why you need to open a link in a new tab.
        The reason I asked this question to myself and started looking for answer was if the link is taking me to a new website I would prefer to open in a new tab. If it is on the same website then there is no need to open in new tab. In addition, if the user starts browsing/clicking on the new opened website then it would be difficult to return to the staring website.
        Now let us get into the technical side of the blog.
        To open a link in a new tab, we will need to look at some of the other attributes of the anchor element's other attributes. The Target Attribute
        This attribute tells the browser how to open the link.
        To open a link in a new tab, just set the target attribute to _blank:

        a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/ " target="_blank">Twitter</a>
        Now when someone clicks on the link, it will open up in a new tab, or possibly a new window depending on the person's browser settings. 
        There is a secutiry issue with target=”_blank” and to avoid this issue you can use rel=”noreferrer noopener”. Here is an example:
        a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/ " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Twitter a

        The rel attribute sets the relationship between your page and the linked URL. Setting it to noopener noreferrer is to prevent a type of phishing known as tabnabbing.
